# 🛍️ Black Friday Sales EDA using PySpark

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Black Friday Sales dataset using **PySpark** in **Google Colab**. The aim is to understand customer purchasing behavior during Black Friday, and how demographic features such as age, gender, and occupation influence spending patterns.

## 🚀 Project Goals

1. **Clean and preprocess** the dataset using PySpark.
2. Perform **EDA** to uncover insights such as:
   - Which age and gender groups spend the most?
   - Which product categories are most popular?
   - How user demographics relate to purchase behavior.
3. Create **visualizations** to communicate key findings.
